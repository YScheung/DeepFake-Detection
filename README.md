#Deep Fake photos features research 

###Introduction:
From other studies, it is found out that major distinctions between deep fake and real images are located at oneâ€™s eyes and lower face (mouth to chin). 
Therefore, in this research project, I would like to examine whether different CNN models will perform better in deep fake detection when face photos are cropped to only contain identifying features compared to uncropped images.
