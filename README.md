# Research on DeepFake detection 

### Introduction:
From other studies, it is found out that major distinctions between deepfake and real images are located at oneâ€™s eyes and lower face (mouth to chin). 
Therefore, in this research project, I would like to examine whether different CNN models, namely mesonet, VGG19 and Resnet50 will perform better in deep fake detection when face photos are cropped to only contain identifying features compared to uncropped images.
